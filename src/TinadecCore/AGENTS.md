# TINADEC CORE KNOWLEDGE

## OVERVIEW
.NET 10 Core runtime and sole state authority. Owns agents, sessions, approvals, model routes, storage, contracts, tracing, and debug APIs.

## STRUCTURE
```
src/TinadecCore/
├── Program.cs          # DI, HTTP routes, tracing init
├── Abstractions/       # service boundary interfaces
├── Contracts/          # DTO/request/event/security contracts
├── Services/           # orchestration, tools, policy, events, model client
├── Storage/            # SQLite persistence and stored model settings
├── Tracing/            # OpenTelemetry, NDJSON, diagnostics, metrics
└── Debug/              # Debug Studio API, simulation, breakpoints, websocket
```

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Add/trace endpoint | `Program.cs` | Minimal API route map is centralized. |
| Change persistence | `Storage/CoreStore.cs` | Largest hotspot; pair with CoreStore tests. |
| Change DTO/request | `Contracts/Models`, `Contracts/Events` | Mirror Desktop `api.ts` after Core changes. |
| Prompt context engineering | `Services/PromptContextService.cs`, `Storage/CoreStore.cs`, `Services/ToolRegistryService.cs` | SQLite prompt fragments, preview assembly, Prompt Context Engineer fallback plan, and read-only `prompt_context_resolve` tool live in Core. |
| Tool policy/discovery/audit | `Services/ToolRegistryService.cs`, `ToolSearchService.cs`, `ToolExecutionTimelineService.cs`, `CapabilityPolicyService.cs` | Approval-first behavior, Core-owned tool registry, searchable discovery metadata, and tool execution timeline summaries. |
| Code-suite registration | `Services/ToolRegistryService.cs` | `CodeCapabilityProvider` registers Tool-layer Code capabilities; keep Code modeled as tools, not a peer orchestrator. |
| Orchestration | `Services/OrchestratorService.cs`, `AgentWorkflowRuntime.cs` | Runs, task graph, read-only tools. |
| Model providers | `Services/ModelProviderCatalog.cs`, `OpenAiCompatibleClient.cs` | Provider-instance model center. |
| Debug/tracing | `Tracing/*`, `Debug/*` | Agent Debug Studio backend. |
| Tests | `tests/TinadecCore.Tests`, `tests/Tinadec.Contracts.Tests` | xUnit; contracts split from behavior tests. |

## CONVENTIONS
- Target framework is `net10.0`; nullable and implicit usings are enabled.
- HTTP JSON uses `JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower`; keep event/DTO casing stable.
- Provider catalog templates now expose family, driver, connection kind, credential kind, timeout, and capability metadata.
- `CoreStore` is SQLite-first and seeds built-in agents/providers/routes/extensions.
- `CoreStore` seeds built-in prompt fragments and stores custom prompt fragments/plans. Built-in prompt fragments are read-only; clone them before editing.
- `PromptContextService` owns Meeting Agent system prompt assembly. Keep full prompt text out of events/tool results; log only fragment ids, estimated token count, context pack ids, and warning counts.
- Tool execution must preserve approval-gated posture.
- Tool layer capabilities are registered in Core. `CodeCapabilityProvider` is the built-in Code suite for project templates, runtime probes, bash-like env, debugging, editor, and Git worktree management.
- `executor_git_manager` is the dedicated Git Manager Subagent. Keep it in the execution layer, bind it to `git_worktree_manager`, and keep push/history mutations approval-gated.
- Tool discovery is Core-owned. `/api/v1/tools/search` must derive provider layer, matched fields, and human-checkpoint summaries from Core descriptors and policy semantics.
- Tool execution visibility is Core-owned. `/api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/tool-executions` must derive timeline state from Core events plus step-result evidence.
- Keep `project_templates` read-only and `project_template_scaffold` approval-gated as `workspace-write`; scaffolding must flow through Core approval before Gateway writes files.
- `SecretProtector` uses DPAPI on Windows; non-Windows fallback is for development only.
- Trace propagation crosses to Gateway/code tools; preserve `traceparent` behavior in client changes.

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- Do not move Core state into Gateway or Desktop.
- Do not mix unrelated API wiring and SQL/schema changes in one broad edit.
- Do not return stored API keys; expose `has_api_key` only.
- Do not run direct dotnet commands on affected Windows env without clearing `Version` and `Ice-Version`.
