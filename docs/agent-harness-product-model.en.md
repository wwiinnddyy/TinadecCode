# TinadecCode Agent Harness Product Model

This document defines TinadecCode's product layers, responsibility boundaries, and long-term direction. It is not a design for a single feature. It is the shared product model that Core, the Tool layer, and the Desktop UI should follow as the system evolves.

## Core Thesis

TinadecCode is not simply a code editor with a chat box. It is a desktop workbench centered on general-purpose agent orchestration:

- **Core** is the universal agent orchestration model and reusable agent harness.
- **Tool layer** is the capability layer that provides discoverable, approval-aware, executable tools.
- **Code** is a built-in tool suite inside the Tool layer, focused on code, projects, and developer environments.
- **Desktop** is the UI presentation layer that turns Core state and Tool-layer capabilities into an understandable, controllable product experience.

These three layers should stay distinct. Core should not become a backend written only for the TinadecCode Desktop shell. The Tool layer should not own orchestration state. Desktop should not hide session state, approvals, routing, or tool policy in local frontend state.

## Three Product Layers

### Core: Universal Agent Orchestration Model

Core is the agent operating-system kernel of the product. It defines how work is understood, decomposed, assigned, supervised, executed, recorded, and audited.

Core owns:

- Authoritative state for projects, sessions, messages, events, and approvals.
- The dual-layer agent model: a planning layer that actively plans and supervises, and an execution layer that passively receives task assignments and returns evidence.
- Task graphs, task nodes, execution assignments, context packs, supervision findings, and step results.
- Model providers, model routes, agent profiles, agent modes, tool descriptors, and permission policy.
- Approval gates, risk modeling, traces, debug APIs, and auditable event streams.
- Stable APIs for tool layers, UI shells, and external harness consumers.

Core is meant to be general. It should drive TinadecCode, but it should also be reusable by other product shells, CLIs, IDE extensions, or automation runtimes. In other words, Core should describe how agent work is organized, not how a particular page is rendered.

### Tool Layer: Capability Provider

The Tool layer sits below Core as the capability layer. It provides concrete features across work domains so the agent harness can operate on the outside world, gather evidence, execute actions, and return structured results.

The Tool layer owns:

- Tool capabilities, metadata, risk levels, input/output contracts, and execution adapters.
- Execution of tool requests authorized by Core, with structured results, evidence, errors, and diagnostics.
- Integration with built-in tools, native tools, MCP tools, ACP tools, browser tools, document tools, code tools, and future tool types.
- Separation between tool implementation and orchestration policy: tools define what can be done and how to execute it; Core decides whether, when, and how it is audited.

### Code: Code Tool Suite Inside The Tool Layer

Code is not a standalone product layer. It is an important built-in tool suite inside the Tool layer. It focuses on developer workflows and gives Core's agent harness code and project capabilities.

The Code tool suite owns:

- **Project templates**: creating, initializing, recognizing, and managing common project structures.
- **Bash-like environment**: command execution, environment variables, working directories, output streams, and error capture for agents and users.
- **Built-in debugging**: run controls, breakpoints, logs, traces, diagnostics, and reproducible experiments.
- **Built-in code editor**: file browsing, editing, diffs, patches, symbol and full-text search, and code review workflows.
- **Git worktree manager**: branches, worktrees, diffs, commits, rebases, conflicts, and isolated execution spaces.
- **Local tool glue**: Rust/native/Codex-backed capabilities such as search, read, grep, patch, sandbox, and review formatting.

Code does not decide whether an agent may perform a risky action. It can declare capabilities, execute tool requests, and return structured results, but approvals, permissions, state recording, and policy decisions belong to Core.

### Desktop: UI Presentation Layer

Desktop is the product experience layer. It should not become a second source of business state. Its role is to make Core and the Tool layer understandable and operable for the user.

Desktop owns:

- Presentation of chat, task graphs, execution assignments, context packs, supervision findings, approvals, and event streams.
- Configuration UI for agents, model providers, model routes, tool bindings, and permission modes.
- UI surfaces for Tool-layer features, including project templates, terminal environment, debugging, editor, diff, and worktree management provided by the Code tool suite.
- Agent Debug Studio, trace timelines, agent graphs, metrics, and simulation or replay UI.
- Interaction design that helps users understand what the agent harness is doing, why approval is needed, and what will happen next.

Desktop's core value is not state ownership. Its value is reducing the cognitive cost of Core and the Tool layer. It should make complex orchestration visible, risks explainable, and tool operations controllable.

## Product Data Flow

A typical user request should flow in this direction:

1. The user starts a goal, selects a project, configures a mode, or makes an approval decision in Desktop.
2. Desktop calls Gateway, and Gateway proxies the request to Core.
3. Core creates or updates session state, then creates a run, task graph, agent assignments, context packs, and supervision findings.
4. Core uses tool descriptors and permission policy to decide which read-only tools may run automatically and which tools require approval.
5. Core requests the Tool layer through tool adapters; the current code-tool path is served by the Code tool adapter.
6. The Tool layer invokes the matching tool implementation; the Code tool suite may call local or native capabilities and return structured results.
7. Core records those results as step results, events, traces, and durable state.
8. Desktop refreshes through HTTP, SSE, or WebSocket channels so the user can see messages, tasks, tool results, approvals, and debug information.

The key boundary is state writeback. Tool outputs from the Tool layer and interactions from Desktop must return to Core instead of creating hidden state outside the harness.

## Dual-Layer Agent Orchestration

TinadecCode's agent model has two layers:

- **Planning layer**: active agents that understand intent, plan tasks, select tools, compress context, supervise quality, and propose evolution.
- **Execution layer**: passive agents that complete concrete task nodes under explicit permission boundaries and tool constraints.

The point of this split is to separate thinking, supervision, and authorization from execution, evidence, and mutation. The planning layer creates structured plans and controls risk. The execution layer performs auditable work. Every mutating action should be traceable to a task node, agent assignment, approval record, and tool result.

## Boundary Rules

- Core owns state, orchestration, approvals, model routing, tool policy, and event logs.
- The Tool layer owns tool implementations, the capability catalog, execution adapters, and structured tool results.
- Code is the code tool suite inside the Tool layer. It owns developer environment capabilities and project-operation features.
- Desktop owns interaction, visualization, configuration forms, and user experience flows.
- Gateway is a proxy and tool bridge. It should not persist core product state.
- Read-only tools may be auto-dispatched by Core policy. File writes, shell, Git, external network access, MCP, ACP, and other high-risk actions must keep human checkpoints.
- Desktop controls such as mode, permission, and agent configuration should eventually map to auditable Core requests or configuration.
- New Tool-layer features should first surface as tool capabilities or service capabilities, then Core should decide how they enter the agent harness, and finally Desktop should present them in the UI.
- New Code features should register as code-tool capabilities inside the Tool layer, not as a separate product layer that bypasses the Tool layer.

## Implications For Future Feature Design

When adding a capability, answer three questions first:

1. **Is this orchestration semantics?**  
   If it defines tasks, state, permissions, approvals, model routes, agent behavior, or audit events, it belongs in Core.

2. **Is this tool capability?**  
   If it provides editing, debugging, shell, templates, worktrees, search, patching, browser operations, document operations, external-system calls, or project operations, it belongs in the Tool layer. Code and project capabilities usually belong to the Code tool suite.

3. **Is this how users see and control the capability?**  
   If it is primarily layout, forms, graphics, interaction, or information presentation, it belongs in Desktop.

This order prevents the product from becoming a frontend state collage, and it prevents any individual tool suite from turning into a second agent runtime that bypasses Core.

## One-Sentence Product Positioning

TinadecCode is a desktop agent workbench: Core provides the universal agent harness, the Tool layer provides executable capabilities, Code is the code tool suite inside that layer, and Desktop presents orchestration, tools, and risk control as an operable UI.
